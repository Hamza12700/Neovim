# Neovim (PDE)

This repo contains all of my [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config files which are based on [LazyVim/Starter](https://github.com/lazyVim/starter/).

## Get Started

> [!NOTE]
> I use `neovim-nightly`, but the configuration should work with stable version of neovim.

Make a backup of your current `neovim` files:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.config/nvim.bak
```

Optional but recommended:

```bash
rm ~/.local/share/nvim
rm ~/.local/state/nvim
rm ~/.cache/nvim
```

Clone the repository and open `nvim`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamza12700/Neovim.git ~/.config/nvim/ && nvim
```
